### About Me 

Hi! I’m Mikel, based in Barcelona, and while I don’t work professionally as a developer, I truly enjoy building things for the web. For me, it’s a mix of creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving—a kind of mental playground where I get to learn, experiment, and have fun.

Web development is something I do in my spare time, mostly as a way to explore ideas and challenge myself to learn new tools and techniques. I find joy in turning concepts into digital experiences, even if the result isn’t perfect—because every project teaches me something new.

I try to keep my projects simple, user-friendly, and visually pleasing. Whether it’s a small experiment or a more involved app, I see each one as a learning opportunity and a way to keep growing.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope something here catches your interest. 🚀
